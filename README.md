  <h1>Reverse Shell</h1>
  
  <p>Remember to use this under a controlled environment, and I will not be responsible for any damage that this piece of code can cause.</p>

  <h2>🐧 Linux Reverse Shell 🐧</h2>
  
  <p>This Linux reverse shell code establishes a reverse shell connection from a target machine to an attacker machine. It prompts the user to enter the remote IP address and the attacker port number.</p>
  
  <p>It validates the user inputs for IP address and port number. Once validated, it creates a socket, connects to the specified IP address and port, and redirects the standard input, output, and error to the socket.</p>
  
  <p>Then, it executes a new shell on the target machine, allowing the attacker to remotely interact with it.</p>

  <h2>🪟 Windows Reverse Shell 🪟</h2>
  
  <p>This Windows reverse shell code establishes a reverse shell connection from a target Windows-based system to an attacker machine.</p>
  
  <p>It prompts the user to enter the remote IP address and the attacker port number. It validates the user inputs for IP address and port number.</p>
  
  <p>Once validated, it initializes the Windows Socket API, creates a socket, and connects to the specified IP address and port.</p>
  
  <p>It then launches a new command prompt process on the target system and redirects the input, output, and error streams to the established socket connection. This allows the attacker to remotely execute commands and receive the results from the target Windows machine.</p>
